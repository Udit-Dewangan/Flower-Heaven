            <h2>Beauty of the Corpse Flower</h2>
            <p>The corpse flower is a unique and fascinating plant that can grow up to 10 feet tall. It features a large, reddish-purple bloom that resembles a massive trumpet. The bloom is surrounded by petal-like structures called bracts, which give it an even more dramatic appearance.</p>
            
            <h2>Where It's Found</h2>
            <p>This extraordinary flower is primarily found in the rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia, and parts of Malaysia. It thrives in warm, humid environments where it can grow in rich, organic soil.</p>
            
            <h2>Why It's Rare</h2>
            <p>The corpse flower is rare due to its specific growing conditions and the fact that it only blooms once every several years. Its peculiar scent, reminiscent of rotting flesh, is used to attract pollinators like carrion beetles and flesh flies, which is a significant factor in its reproductive strategy.</p>

            <h2>Blooming Season</h2>
            <p>The corpse flower typically blooms in late summer or early fall, although the exact timing can vary. The bloom lasts only for about 24 to 48 hours, making it a highly anticipated event for botanical gardens and flower enthusiasts alike.</p>
            
            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The corpse flower can weigh over 200 pounds when in bloom.</li>
                <li>It can emit heat during flowering, helping to spread its scent further.</li>
                <li>The flower is often referred to as the "Titan Arum."</li>
